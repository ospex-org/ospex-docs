## After Wallet Connection

The top-right corner also displays your wallet address, current USDC balance, and approved USDC amount. Refer to our [**Glossary**](/docs/glossary) for more details.

- **Contest Scoring:** If a contest is yet to start or in progress, your position will indicate its status. Once concluded, this area becomes interactive, allowing you to score the contest on the [**Contest Scoring**](https://ospex.org/c/score) page. Final odds will also be accessible here after the contest begins.
