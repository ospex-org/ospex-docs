# How It Works

Ospex leverages the Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) to facilitate the creation and scoring of sports contests across various leagues, including NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAA football, and NCAA basketball.

## Contest Creation and Scoring

When contests are created, the unique identifiers for the contest from three independent sports APIs are stored on the blockchain as reference IDs. These IDs are then utilized to verify the final results once the contest concludes. If the results from these sources match, they are recorded on chain. Subsequently, any speculations dependent on these results are scored accordingly.

### Handling Discrepancies

What happens if the results from the sources do not match? [**See the "Edge Cases" section**](#edge-cases) for detailed information on how Ospex addresses discrepancies in contest results.

## Why Chainlink?

Choosing the Chainlink DON allows Ospex to ensure that contest data is accurate, reliable, and tamper-proof.
