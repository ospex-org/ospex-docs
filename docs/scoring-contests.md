# Scoring Contests

Scoring contests on Ospex is a crucial step in the lifecycle of a contest, ensuring that the outcomes are accurately reflected and participants can claim their winnings. Speculations are scored automatically; once a contest is scored, all speculations associated with that contest will be scored shortly thereafter.

## How to Score a Contest

To score a contest, navigate to the [**contest scoring page**](https://ospex.org/c/score). You can also reach this page via your positions if you hold a position in the contest in question.

Once the contest is underway, a "Score Contest" button will appear. Clicking this button initiates the scoring process. Please ensure that the contest has concluded before attempting to score it. For the scoring to be accurate, all three APIs must provide data confirming the contest's conclusion. The results from each independent source will be verified by the DON to ensure consistency in the reported scores.

### Ensuring Consistency and Accuracy

The integrity of the scoring process relies on the confirmation from multiple APIs. This redundancy check is designed to safeguard against discrepancies and maintain the reliability of the platform.

## Discrepancies

There may be rare instances where the APIs return conflicting results, or perhaps one of the sources fails to return data. For such situations, Ospex has a set of protocols to follow.
