# What is ospex.org?

**Ospex** is a open-source decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to speculate on the outcome of sports contests. Unlike traditional platforms, Ospex is characterized by its **no fee / low fee** structure, **anonymity**, and **unrestricted access**. It's designed to offer a transparent and fair environment for sports speculation.

Ospex users can create contests and speculations based on real-life sports events and participate by creating positions on potential outcomes.

Currently, Ospex is deployed on the [**Polygon network**](https://polygon.technology/), leveraging its efficiency and lower transaction costs. To interact with the platform, you'll need a crypto wallet and specific tokens:

- **MATIC** (Required): For transaction fees on the Polygon network.
- **USDC** (Required): For creating positions and receiving winnings.
- **LINK** (Optional): Utilized for creating and scoring contests. LINK must be converted to Polygon-compatible LINK via [**PegSwap**](https://pegswap.chain.link/).

Ospex is hosted on GitHub: [**Source code**](https://github.com/ospex-org).
