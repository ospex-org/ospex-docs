# Creating Contests and Speculations

In Ospex, users may create contests and engage in various types of speculations. This guide outlines the types of speculations available and the steps to create these contests and speculations.

## Types of Speculations

Ospex allows for the creation of three primary types of speculations:

- [**Spread**](/docs/glossary/#spread) - A speculation on the point / run / goal difference between the winning and losing teams.
- [**Moneyline**](/docs/glossary/#moneyline) - A speculation on the winner of the contest.
- [**Total**](/docs/glossary/#total) - A speculation on the total points / runs / goals scored in the contest.

## Creating Contests and Speculations

### Step 1: Create a Contest

To begin creating a contest, access the [**Contest Creation**](https://ospex.org/c/create) page. You may use the search box to find a specific team and quickly create a contest.

### Step 2: Increase Gas

You will need to increase the amount of gas used for contest creation within your wallet when you execute the transaction.

### Step 3: Create Speculation(s)

Once the contest is created, you can choose which type of speculation(s) you want to create. It's important to note that both a contest and at least one speculation must exist before positions may be created.
